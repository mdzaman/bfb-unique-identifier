I'll provide a step-by-step guide to help you set up and run this React application locally on your Mac.

1. First, you'll need to install some prerequisites:

   a. Install Node.js:
   - Open your browser and go to https://nodejs.org
   - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for macOS
   - Double click the downloaded file and follow the installation wizard

   b. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
   - Go to https://code.visualstudio.com
   - Download the macOS version
   - Move the downloaded VS Code app to your Applications folder

2. Create a new Next.js project:
   - Open Terminal (you can find it using Spotlight search - press Cmd + Space and type "Terminal")
   - Type these commands one at a time:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   npx create-next-app@latest my-dashboard
   ```
   - When prompted, answer the questions as follows:
     - Would you like to use TypeScript? → No
     - Would you like to use ESLint? → Yes
     - Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? → Yes
     - Would you like to use `src/` directory? → Yes
     - Would you like to use App Router? → Yes
     - Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? → Yes

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd my-dashboard
   npm install @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog @shadcn/ui lucide-react
   ```

4. Set up shadcn/ui components:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   ```
   - When prompted, accept the default options

5. Install the required shadcn/ui components:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add select
   ```

6. Create the component file:
   - Open VS Code: `code .`
   - In VS Code, create a new file at `src/app/page.js`
   - Copy and paste the entire code from the paste.txt into this file

7. Update the code:
   - Remove the React import line since it's not needed in Next.js App Router
   - In the Select component for shares, fix the SelectItem content (there's a syntax error in the code)
   - Replace this section:
   ```javascript
   {Array.from({length: MAX_SHARES}, (_, i) => i + 1).map(num => (
     <SelectItem key={num} value={num.toString()}>
       {`${num} share${num > 1 ? 's' : ''} ($${(num * SHARE_PRICE).toFixed(2)})`}
     </SelectItem>
   ))}
   ```

8. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

9. View your application:
   - Open your browser
   - Go to http://localhost:3000

The dashboard should now be running locally on your machine. You can access it through your web browser, and any changes you make to the code will automatically update in the browser.

Common issues and solutions:

1. If you see module not found errors:
   - Make sure all the dependencies are installed correctly
   - Try running `npm install` again

2. If the styles don't look right:
   - Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
   - Check that all shadcn/ui components are installed

3. If the server won't start:
   - Make sure no other application is using port 3000
   - Try stopping and restarting the development server

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail?
